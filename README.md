# RockGameplayEvents
A relatively simple event system for hooking up instanced actors and ability to broadcast events

# The problem we are trying to solve
If you have ever wanted to connect the output event from 1 actor placed in the editor and trigger a function on another actor, but specifically hooking it up without the level blueprint and in the level editor.
Additionally without potential limitations of interfaces and/or components.

# Why you should use this plugin
If you want to connect an broadcastable event from 1 actor to another in the editor. 
If you want to accomplish this with ANY actor, no components and no interfaces.

Trigger: All you need is either an exposed RockGameplayEventDelegate variable in C++ or BP on the triggering actor
Receiver: All you need is a Function that matches the signature `void AnyNamedFunction(const AController*)` in either C++ or Blueprint. 

# How simple is it?
All you have to do is add a Broadcast Event when something happens

## C++
`OnHit.BroadcastEvent(someController);`
## Blueprint

To add at runtime

## C++
`OnHit.OnGameplayEvent.AddDynamic(this, &ABoxBase::SpinReceiver);`
## Blueprint
TBD



# How does it look in the editor?

With this plugin: you can hook up event listeners in the Unreal Engine's level editor. Between placed actors
Such as with a lightswitch and a light or a TriggerPad and a Door.

There are other great event systems out there that solve different issues.
Such as Lyra's GameplayMessageSubsystem or our modified version of it https://github.com/brokenrockstudios/GameplayMessageRouter

Also, there are many times where you likely just want to use a traditional `DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE` or some other built in solutions.
However, most all of these don't support hooking up 2 independent actors that are placed in a level without the usage of the Level Blueprint or other handcoded mechanisms.
